# C3DIS Python Workshops
## Hands-on Exercises

The notebooks included here cover a range of scientific domains and focus areas.
Although they are intended to supplement the Python for Scientists training
course, they can be completed by anyone with some Python experience. The
notebooks are self-contained and can be completed in any order. However, if you
have little to no Python experience, it is suggested that you start with the
Introduction to Python notebook.
