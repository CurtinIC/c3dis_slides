    "# Background\n",
    "[Object-oriented programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is a programming methodology based on objects. An object can be viewed as the combination of data or state and the operations that can be performed on the data (behaviour). The data items are often called fields or attributes while the operations are known as methods. In addition to objects, OOP frequently makes use of a number of other concepts, including abstraction, encapsulation, composition, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism. We will examine how most of these concepts can be utilised in Python, but we won't spend too much time on the theory."

    "# Inheritance\n",
    "An aspect of OOP that we have yet to look at is inheritance. Inheritance allows you to derive a new class from an existing one to build up a hierarchy of related classes that differ in key ways. Typical examples include building a class hierarchy to draw shapes on a screen. You may have a `Shape` class with all the common data and behaviours (position, color etc), and then derive sub-classes to define specialised shapes: `Circle`, `Square` etc. The sub-classes add the unique data and behaviours required for just that one type of shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't want to get drawn too deeply into the principles, benefits, and risks of inheritance hierarchies here. The goal is to look at how to implement inheritance in Python. Whether building a class hierarchy is a good idea for your application is a much harder question to answer.\n",

    "In [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex44.html) inheritance is described as an evil forest full of traps, dangers, and complexity. I highly recommend reading that linked chapter of Learn Python the Hard Way. It describes quite clearly some of the complexities that inheritance can lead to, and an alternative solution known as composition or aggregation. Be that as it may, inheritance is everywhere in Python, so it pays to understand the basics. \n",

    "## New Style Objects vs Old Style Objects\n",
    "What was that about inheritance being everywhere in Python? In Python 3, all classes implicitly inherit from a special system class called `object`. The `object` class provides core functionality that is common to all Python objects. So all the `Cup` classes we have created have already been using inheritance implicitly. If you paid attention to the output from `dir(Cup)`, you will have noticed a whole bunch of items that we didn't define. They come from `object`."

To use new style objects in Python 2, you had to explicitly inherit from the new `object` class:\n",
